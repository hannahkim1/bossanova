            <p>The term "bossa nova" literally translates to new trend in Portuguese. </p>
            
            <p>
                Originating in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in the late 1950s, bossa nova has brought the unique culture of Brazilian samba and American jazz together. Bossa nova music relies on the singer’s nasally, yet sultry vocals and simple instruments, to create an iconic gentle and simple rhythm. Rio de Janeiro's sunny beaches were the ultimate influence on the beautifully poetic yet simplistic lyrics. The lyrics written in Portuguese portray stories of love and the slow paced daily life in Rio. Bossa nova promoted this beautiful idea of paradise, a beautiful language with romantic imagery of calming beaches and euphoria. Bossa nova gives the listener a feeling of nostalgia- even if the listener had never experienced the unique lifestyle of Rio.

            <p>
                Bossa nova was created in the 1950s, and became a Brazilian classic. The bossa nova sound was loved throughout the 50s in Brazil, and it wasn't until the early 60s when America joined the fun. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bossa nova is not just a music genre, but was also a representation of a small point in Brazilian history. This brief bossa nova period of time was during a "period of democracy... in between two spells of military dictatorship" (Lewis). The people felt a sense of hope with the new leadership of President Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira.
            </p>

            <p>
                The middle class Brazilians in the Copacabana neighborhood were the vital spine in bossa nova music. The middle class students and struggling musicians who were regulars at the local jazz clubs yet have also been exposed to American pop culture and media were inspired to create a fresh sound. Music clubs were exclusive, and live music was really only a luxury that the upper class could experience. With bossa nova, the lower-middle class were able to contribute and bring new sounds to the music industry.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, with this happy and carefree music genre becoming more popular, many were critical of the seemingly zero class consciousness and alienation from actual Brazilian culture that bossa nova was presenting. At this time, the Brazilian government began restricting musicians’ right to free speech, and wanted the simple and carefree songs of bossa nova to continue being shown and more accessible to the world. Singing about beautiful women and bright, blue skies was not necessarily thought provoking. As this criticism for deeper-meaning music continued, bossa nova music began to die down in Brazil, but continued getting more popular in the US. Tropicalia began in the early 1960s. Tropicalia was heavily inspired by bossa nova and American rock and became the main form of protest from the restrictive government. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As Tropicalia was taking off, the US was absolutely loving bossa nova. Frank Sinatra and Stan Getz were two of the biggest American artists to help spread the bossa nova craze in America. Sinatra recorded an album with legendary bossa nova artist, Antonio Carlos Jobim. Stan Getz recorded multiple bossa nova albums, including one with another legendary artist, Joao Gilberto. Bossa nova’s success relied on the power of collaboration.  In fact, bossa nova became so widely popular in the US, that the first ever bossa nova concert in the US took place at Carnegie Hall in 1962.

        <div class="tomJobimSection">
            <p>Born on January 25th, 1927, Antonio Carlos Jobim (or Antonio Carlos Brasilerio de Almeida), also famously known as Tom Jobim, was one of bossa nova's most influential artists. Jobim was a composer, a singer, a songwriter, a player of many instruments. Jobim would play his music in jazz clubs in Rio before becoming the music director of one of the largest recording studios in Brazil, Odeon Records. His most famous work is Garota de Ipanema and the first ever bossa nova song, Chega de Saudade in 1958. He collaborated with many artists and produced wildly popular songs. Desafinado, Wave, and Corcovado are some of his most popular. Jobim has an airport named after him. The only international airport in Rio de Janeiro has his name on it!</p>

        <div class="joaoGilbertoSection">
            <p>Joao Gilberto, living from June 10th 1931 to July 6th of 2019, was often considered the father of bossa nova. His album collaborations with Jobim solidified the "founding blueprints for bossa nova style" (Daley) with his guitar rhythms and sultry songs. He was married to bossa nova vocal powerhouse, Astrud Gilberto.</p>

        <div class="artistsAdditionalInfo">

                    However, underneath the sunny and nostalgic image that is bossa nova, lies underlying racism and erasure of the African-Brazilian influence. 
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                As I was researching and diving deeper into the true "influencers" of bossa nova, Joao Gilberto and Tom Jobim kept popping up. But there was one name in particular that I have not recognized in all of my research, until I encountered it whilst reading this article, “Bossa Nova and white fear: Subtle mechanisms of racism erased Johnny Alf as the “Father” of one of the most important musical movements in Brazil”.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <p>
                Johnny Alf is sometimes considered as the true father of bossa nova. He got his start by playing in small jazz clubs in the Copacabana neighborhood. He would play at Hotel Plaza, where Antonio Carlos Jobim frequently watched him perform. In 1955, Alf’s song, Rapaz de Bem or Good boy in english, was considered to be the actual first bossa nova song. Jobim actually told Alf that his hit song Desafinado was heavily inspired by Rapaz de Bem.

            <p>
                <strong>
                    Why was it that Alf is not as well known, even though he was one of the first on the trend and one of the first to inspire some of the biggest names in bossa nova?
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Simply, it was because Johnny Alf was black, queer, and the son of a housemaid to a wealthy white family, that his name does not appear on any articles or websites discussing bossa nova artists. Alf’s image did not fit the image that bossa nova wanted to promote.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Bossa nova is beautiful, however it is important to discuss how it helped promote euro-centric view of Brazilian culture, and how it silenced the untold stories of those that had such a significant influence.

                The Netflix show, Coisa Mais Linda, or Girls from Ipanema in the US, 
                portrays a story of a young woman from the city breaking away from her family's strict rules and opens her own jazz club for her
                passion of bossa nova. The show has really beautiful shots of Rio and I fell in love with bossa nova at the exact same time as
                the main character, Malu, in the pilot episode. The soundtrack and cinematography was what made me obsessed. 
                This show, being produced by Netflix, introduced bossa nova to so many people, including myself.
