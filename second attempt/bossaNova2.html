                        Originating in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in the late 1950s, bossa nova has brought the unique cultures of Brazilian samba and American jazz together.                    </p>

                        Bossa nova music relies on the singer’s nasally, yet sultry vocals and simple instruments, to create an iconic, gentle rhythm. A majority of bossa nova songs have minimalistic lyrics written in Portuguese, which portray stories of love and the slow paced daily life in Rio.                     </p>

                        Bossa nova promotes an idea of paradise, a beautiful language with romantic imagery of vacationing on Copacabana beach. Bossa nova gives the listener a feeling of nostalgia- even if the listener has never experienced this unique lifestyle.                    </p>

                        Created in the 1950s, bossa nova became a Brazilian classic soon after. Bossa nova was loved throughout the 50s in Brazil, but it wasn’t until the early 60s when America joined the fun.                     </p>

                        Bossa nova is not just a music genre, but is a representation of the Brazilian people’s general perspectives during a vital point in Brazilian history. The mid to late 1950s was a period of economic growth and democratic rule in between long periods of political instability. With the new leadership of President Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira, the people felt a sense of hope.                    </p>

                        The middle class Brazilians in the Copacabana neighborhood were the backbone of bossa nova. The students and the struggling musicians who were regulars at the local jazz clubs had been influenced by American media, and were inspired to create a fresh sound.                     </p>

                        Music clubs were exclusive, and live music was mostly only a luxury that was available to the upper class. Bossa nova created an opportunity for the lower-middle class to contribute to the music industry, immensely.                    </p>

                        Later on, as bossa nova became more popular and mainstream, many were critical of the lack of class consciousness and alienation of actual Brazilian culture.                     </strong></p>

                        At this time, the Brazilian government began restricting musicians’ right to free speech. The government wanted the world to think of Brazil as the place to go if you want to experience this carefree life as presented in bossa nova.                     </p>

                        Singing about beautiful women and bright, blue skies was not necessarily thought provoking. As this criticism for deeper-meaning music continued, bossa nova began to die down in Brazil; however, it continued gaining popularity in the US.                     </p>

                        Bossa nova rhythm is a two bar pattern influenced by the syncopated claves in Afro-Cuban and traditional Brazilian samba music. This two bar pattern combined with a slower tempo creates a unique sound.Here is a short biography of some of the most important artists of the bossa nova movement.                     </p>

                        In 1955, Alf’s song, Rapaz de Bem (Good Boy), was considered to be the first actual bossa nova song. In fact, Jobim told Alf that his hit song Desafinado was heavily inspired by Rapaz de Bem.                    </p>
